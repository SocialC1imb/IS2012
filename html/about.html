                        <p class = "AltFont">I have been singing for as long as I can remember, and although I don't take lessons or perform (often)
                            anymore, I don't plan on stopping! I sing mainly, but I also play a handful of instruments,
                            such as guitar, bass, piano, and drums. I was a part of the School of Rock - Plano performance group for quite a few 
                            years and was even in my own band with a couple of friends (and I aam thinking about starting another). I actually have
                            one song released on streaming platforms too, under the name of "Sky Toups"!

                            books, movies, podcasts, or other forms of media. As nerdy as it is, I really love writing comics and doing horror art 
                            pieces! A lot of my recent art from this year can be found on my twitter! Some of my favorite pieces I've done recently can be seen below.

                            about them! My end goal for a career is that I can become a pilot for an airline such as Southwest Airlines. although
                            I haven't currently started lessons, I have done test flights and love flying, so I hope to 
                            be able to start soon!

                           My love of traveling is actually what inspired me to look into aviation as a future 
                           career. The coolest place I have been to, hands down, is Ireland! I traveled
                           throughout the entire country and got to sing in multiple cathedrals and chapels.
                           I even got to meet the mayor of Dublin and perform for him and his peers.</p>
